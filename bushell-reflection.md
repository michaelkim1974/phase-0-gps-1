Before I had my GPS session I was struggling with opening my sublime files from the command line.

During the GPS the driver/navigator roles were clarified

I asked my pair about his day, and I asked my guide about certain code specifics.

Sometimes I get confused about what branch I'm looking for.

My first experience was good. I liked my partner and my guide.
