* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I struggled a bit with the concept of fetch and merge as we had not covered them in the previous course material.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Along with the aforementioned fetch/merge commands, the concepts behind merge conflict were greatly clarified the session; namely the difference between a conflict and when one branch is behind another.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Most questions and discussion with my pair centered around our individual working styles and how we can best integrate them.  With my guide, I asked her questions regarding what it mean to be a collaborator and what that means in terms of how much access they have to the repository.  I also asked her a couple of questions regarding life after Dev Bootcamp.

* What still confuses you about Git?

Sometime I can get lost in making sure all changes have been added and commited when working with more persons other than myself.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first experience in a pairing session was very positive.  I felt I worked well with my pairing partner and that we communicated effectively.  Also, I appreciated how our guide took a hands off approach and allowed us to figure things out on our own for the most part.
